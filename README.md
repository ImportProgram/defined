# defined

A plugin/API/code management system thats under 5k (min).


## Why use defined?
Defined was created because how third party plugins can be executed. I didn't want "unsafe" code to be used, so with defined you can load folders of code and set there properties. One folder can be a API folder, which can be called on by the main program created. This API can have REQUIRE enabled, which is an amazing feature to enable and disable because not all plugins need REQUIRE. Also having the code based on custom register allows for plugins to emit to the API but not to each other. Lastly defined is only using AMD-loader for asyncronous loading of code. 

## Using it
- Please take a look at the example, its easy to understand that way.
